# Schedule

* 05.01.2018 [Jan Lasek](http://lasek.rexamine.com/) **Measuring the efficacy of league formats in ranking football teams**
> Choosing between different tournament designs based on their accuracy in ranking teams is an important topic in football since many domestic championships underwent changes in the recent years. In particular, the transformations of Ekstraklasa -- the top-tier football competition in Poland -- is a topic receiving much attention from the organizing body of the competition, participating football clubs as well as supporters. In this presentation we will discuss the problem of measuring the accuracy of different league formats in ranking teams. We will present various models for rating teams that will be next used to simulate a number of tournaments to evaluate their efficacy, for example, by measuring the probability of the best team win. Finally, we will discuss several other aspects of league formats including the influence of the number of points allocated for a win on the final league standings.

* 24.11.2017 [Grzegorz Siudem](http://www.if.pw.edu.pl/~siudem/) **How accidental scientific success is?**
> Since the classic work of de Sola Price the rich get richer rule is well known as a most important mechanism governing the citation network dynamic. (Un-)Fortunatelly it is not sufficient to explain every aspect of the bibliometric data. Using the proposed agent-based model for the bibliometric networks we will shed some light on the problem and try  to answer the important question from the title.  Joint work with [A. Cena](http://cena.rexamine.com), [M. Gagolewski](http://www.gagolewski.com) and B. Żogała-Siudem.
