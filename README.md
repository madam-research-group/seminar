# Schedule

* 23.11.2017 [Grzegorz Siudem](http://www.if.pw.edu.pl/~siudem/) *How accidental scientific success is?*
> Since the classic work of de Sola Price the rich get richer rule is well known as a most important mechanisms behind the citation network dynamics. (Un-)Fortunatelly it is not sufficient to explain every aspect of the bibliometric data, so it is not clear how much the process should be preferential and how much accidental. Using the proposed agent-based model for the bibliometric networks we will try to answer the question from the title.   Joint work with [A. Cena](http://cena.rexamine.com), [Marek Gagolewski](http://www.gagolewski.com) and B. Żogała-Siudem.
