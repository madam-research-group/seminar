# Schedule

* 24.11.2017 [Grzegorz Siudem](http://www.if.pw.edu.pl/~siudem/) **How accidental scientific success is?**
> Since the classic work of de Sola Price the rich get richer rule is well known as a most important mechanisms governs the citation network dynamic. (Un-)Fortunatelly it is not sufficient to explain every aspect of the bibliometric data. Using the proposed agent-based model for the bibliometric networks we will sched some light on the problem and try  to answer the important question from the title.   Joint work with [A. Cena](http://cena.rexamine.com), [Marek Gagolewski](http://www.gagolewski.com) and B. Żogała-Siudem.
